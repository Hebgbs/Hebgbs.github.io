# Quick guide for Fire HD 7+ to install Google's Play app market
_*This only applies to adult profiles!*_  

As the new proud owner of a Fire HD 8 tablet, I was disappointed to see Amazon's marketplace hadn't made available all of the applications I typically have access to using my phone. So this quick guide will get you up-and-running. created after some trial and error for the normies who want to break free and do all of the other Android things they already do using their handset or other tablets.  

**Remember to check Amazon's app market first for everything you wish to install.** Some select applications exist there which may be better optimized for the Amazon Fire HD series of tablets.  

_If you see a QR code, you can scan that with any variety of QR code scanners available from Amazon's app market._

> #### Google Play Store
> [[Download link]](https://www.apkmirror.com/wp-content/themes/APKMirror/download.php?id=2371237&forcebaseapk)  
> _Alternatively, scan code to download:_

### This is very important.
The version of Play provided will have _My apps and games_ in the user menu at the upper right. As I was writing this, I encountered special issues with software not installing after searching for and initiating retrieval through the Play store. I found the easiest way t resolve this is to **restart the device** after installation, so that the latest version of PLay is retrieved post-boot and the avatar menu contains _Manage apps and games_ which then allowed for the installation of software through Google Play.  

You could also likely wait a few minutes before opening, but I found rebooting is more fool-proof **so long you are already connected to the Internet.**

### "Checking info" loop and sign-in issues
If you open Google Play and after five minutes had elapsed, the info check loop doesn't break, then go into your device settings and under _Apps & Notifications_ view information for each of the four applications you've installed.  

For each, _Force stop_ if applicable, then view _Storage_; _Clear cache_ if applicable, then _Clear data_. Try opening Google Play again — This should resolve the issue of not being able to input your Google account credentials for accessing your Google Play-installed applications.  

For signing in, after you had signed in you may not immediately g to the Google Play application after signing in. You should be able to press the Back button (`◀`) and proceed to Google Play with your account. Else you should be able to remove the process from the task manager ('◻️', swipe up or left depending on display orientation) and open Google Play again.

### Solving Alexa's split personality complex
***Do not install Amazon Alexa from the Google Play store.*** Instead, click on your avatar in Google Play, and select _Manage apps & devices_. Browse the _Manage_ tab, then select Amazon Alexa from this list. Tap the kebab menu (`⋮`) at the upper right and toggle _Enable auto update_ off. (By default, it will be on.) _Repeat for Amazon Kindleand other apps shown which had been retrieved from the Amazon Apps application._  

If you make the dire mistake of installing Alexa, Kindle or other applicable apps from the Play Store and issues occur trying to open them, then remove it through device settings and open the Amazon app store to install them. Specific to Alexa, After pressing _Get_ to download and install it the button should change to _Update_ to receive the latest version post-installation.

### Using alternative app markets
There are many other alternatives to both Amazon and Google's marketplaces. A popular alternative is [UpToDown](https://uptodown-android.en.uptodown.com/android), which if you do not need _any_ of Google's services, should help in finding everything you need (so long they do not rely on Google Play services). An alternative focusing _only_ on open-source applications is [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org), if you do not want a market catering to the needs of people seeking proprietary, closed-source applications.  

While vendors providing their own storefronts will always have the most current version of their own applications, _these vendors may not have the latest version of other hosted applications in their repositories_ so that is worth bearing in mind while browsing other markets, either online or through dedicated applications for browsing their selection.  

Where applicable, **disable automatic updates for Amazon Apps-installed applications through these other vendors.** Just like Google Play, you may inadvertently install a copy of Alexa from other vendors, which may cause similar inoperability issues to installing the build from Google Play. If it's unlisted, it won't be updated as _to those markets_ their version is not installed — is it only when a software version matches existing, already-installed software will you see installed applications through other vendors.  

_Specifically for UpToDown App Store_ as I am familiar with this, the option to disable automatic update of an existing application after finding it will _not_ appear in the kebab menu until you perform something else, like hitting the Share button, exiting the menu which will appear, then opening the kebab menu once more. A bit quirky and unintuitive (has any part of this been intuitive??) but I find this to work.

### Installing for other profiles
Move the APK files for Google Play to a formatted USB device, then eject it in the provided Files application or in Settings, _Storage_ to remove it. Switch profiles, Plug it back in and open Files to browse the USB drive, install the four APK profiles shown at the top of this guide and begin from the very important information after the APK links.  

Once finished for each profile, enjoy your new Fire tablet — now with more of the free applications you loved from Google Play and alternative app markets.
