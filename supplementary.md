# About [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) and conduct therein
It should be understood that Linux Enthuiast Group is a place that is discussion-focused, not assistance-focused. _However_ due to the nature of conversation, support is merely consequential and it is never guaranteed you will receive a good answer to any problem you present, _let alone_ any response at all.

In spite of this consequential nature, we should do our very best, to provide the best we can for all given problems in scenarios we may possess expertise in, or at the very least improve our collective search-fu to provide a satisfactory response, and validate possible solutions. _Other things_ you can do to help resolve issues may also be to seek documentation, consult manuals for a given application, and / or _short of that_ install and use `tldr`, which may be helpful for individuals who are not willing to install a given software, but provide a brief for individuals who had yet to read a software's manual.

Most of all, your core objective _above all else_ is to improve the recipient's capability to solve their own problems. It may be tempting â€” and in some circumstances ideal â€” to provide a direct answer, depending on how much time it was required of you to figure out a solution, but at your own discretion, you may also choose to lead an individual along so they are forced to learn as they go with guidance as a means of helping an indivudual educate oneself, rather than leading them blindly through something where comprehension of a solution is not guaranteed. Of course, if somebody views this behaviour as patronizing and insulting, you may provide a direct answer if such is requested.

# Guidelines
1. **If you do not know, you do not know.** While shooting advice from the hip and flying blind with nothing but one's own intuition can _occasionally_ help as hints and clues toward the solution for a given problem, limiting speculation is _key_ to successfully resolving any given problem.
2. Presenting the issue first-and-foremost is of utmost importance to begin evaluation of a solution for a given problem. _Never start with "Hello"._ â€” we can't help with just a greeting!
3. Provide all information you have for a given problem. If you aren't sure what the answer to your ongoing issue(s) may be based on that, somebody else might!
4. Toxicity helps nobody, so do not become toxic toward persons who are not able to effectively communicate their problem. _Give people time_ and provide improvements to any explanations provided if possible so if you cannot help, other persons who may can resolve an issue with greater clarity.
5. Do not write in multiple lines what can be explained in a single post. On discretion of staff at time of receiving, it may be considered spam and removed.
6. **Use threads!** You have permission to create threads in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) so you have no excuse as to why you can't. They help with indexing problems and isolating conversation so your issues are less likely to get lost in the channel!

### Music
You are free to play music and video content, but please do not be offensive about it. If your content includes excessive profane lyrics, or is intentionally meant to offend as many persons as possible it _might_ not be nest to play it in our guild.

Core exceptions to this are instrumentals (without offensive samples) and songs with offensive titles, but without lyrics and devoid of gross depictions.

### Image bombing
Abuse of carl's image-bombing features such as `catbomb`, `dogbomb` and `awwbomb` will be considered spam and you will be timed out for such behaviour. Image-bombing is **strictly** limited to [#botcmds](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/673343034284310574), _unless_ in threads strictly about imaages, such as the [Wallpaper thread](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/920440255734243438/920440257109983283) in #general.

# About #memes
1. Do not weaponize or be perverse with them, as meme images are subject to the same rules as in other channels and any use of #memes to cause harm against other users or person-groups will **not** be tolerated.
2. The memes channel is not your toilet, please do not ðŸ’©post solely to generate controversy or otherwise share inappropriate content.
3. Make a best effort to limit posts outside of this channel to relevant topics, as contextual levity is often welcome.

Basically just _be good_ and post things everyone may find funny, or at the very least may act indifferently toward.
