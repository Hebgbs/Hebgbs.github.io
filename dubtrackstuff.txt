|                === Theming modules ===                 |
| These things are intended to be used as part of a more |
| cohesive set of imports for custom CSS, but most of it |
| can be installed via userstyles.org if you see no need |
|  to utilize third-party scripts for the same purpose.  |

> Better chat
  A comprehensive set of changes mostly affecting the right section and
  PM box. The intent of this style is to allow for highlighting of rows
  in chat and people, and fix some gaps that occur because of the right
  section not having a background colour.

> Better player header
  A small style intended for the playlist header, when no other styles
  which affect it are in use. This style makes it so all buttons are
  the same size, instead of the strangeness that is seen right now.

> PMs always on top
  A very small adendum that probably is not necessary anymore, so the
  PM box is on top of the now playing bar when Duntrack is in mini-mode.

> Thinner text
  Made as an attempt to make DubTrack look more "Modern" with reduced
  font weights. Makes most text go on a diet.

> Rainbow sliders and progress bars
  Because why not? This style affects the volume sliders, progress bar
  in content preview and the now playing bar, going so far as to include
  additional content at the bottom to fake progress remaining. Animated!

> Rainbow stuff for Chillout Mixer
  Same as above, except a bit muted to go with the chilly blue theme
  for Chillout Mixer.

|                  === Complete theme sets ===                  |
| These are themes I have done for other communities and people |
| who have requested my services as a front-end hobbiest. These |
|  styles will most likely have derivative code from the above  |
| or use derivative code from elsewhere as necessary to fulfill |
| their requests. Most of these themes imply you'll abandon use |
|   of a community's theme in favour of your own preferences.   |

> Chillout Mixer
  A smoky blue theme indended to calm both mind and spirit in a bid to
  encourage the playing of slow, down-tempo ambiance.

> Frosolf's custom theme
  Using the same colour scheme as Chillout Mixer, except with a lot of
  stuff for NightBlue3 by netox005 as well.

> Personal theme
  My own changes to Dubtrack. It's not too extreme, but you can use it
  as the base of your own theme!
