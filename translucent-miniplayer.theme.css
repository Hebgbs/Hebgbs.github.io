/*//META{"name":"Translucent miniplayer","description":"Makes it possible to see through the miniplayer to see content underneath. If on PTB, this effect creates a translucent effect instead, which can be disabled by removing the import which allows these effects.","author":"Hebgbs","version":"1.0"}*//**/

/* === Preface ===
   The intent of this code is to make the video stream
   of a target appear to the receiving end-user as
   translucent, with a diffused backdrop.

   === Function summary ===
   This is achieved by making the picture-in-picture
   miniplayer and its video stream use a transparent
   background, then adjusting the opacity of the target
   stream. It was later modified to include beta-only
   level 2 filters for other effects behind it.
   Additional functionality is the removal of the
   "Live" badge in PiP mode, transition effect and
   cursor removal if it is idled on the miniplayer.

   The end effect is a translucent player, showing the
   contents underneath with other means to further
   obfuscate the content beneath. More info in notes.

/* === Code notes ===
   N1: Beta effects are held in another sheet. In case
       you don't want them, remove the PTB-fx import.
       If you want to play with these effects, then add
       TMP-diffuse, TMP-invert and TMP-bright into your
       custom CSS's :root block.
