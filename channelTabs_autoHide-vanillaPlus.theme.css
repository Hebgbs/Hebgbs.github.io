/* === Preface ===
   This theme combines together the "Vanilla+" theming I've
   committed for ChannelTabs while at the same time making it
   disappear, showing nothing in its minimized state when there
   are no messages in channels, or no mentions / DMs toward you.

   The result is something that appears to integrate better with
   Discord's guild bar while politely preventing burn-in.
