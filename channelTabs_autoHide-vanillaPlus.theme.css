/**
  * @name ChannelTabs â€” Vanilla+ with autohide
  * @description Providing slight improvements for ChannelTabs with Discord's default colours, linear gradient hackery and a highly animated autohide feature, this theme is both punchy and polite as tabs hide themselves away until you receive a guild message, mention or DM..
  * @author Hebgbs
  * @version 1.5
*/

/* === Preface ===
   This theme combines together the "Vanilla+" theming I've
   committed for ChannelTabs while at the same time making it
   disappear, showing nothing in its minimized state when there
   are no messages in channels, or no mentions / DMs toward you.

   The result is something that appears to integrate better with
   Discord's guild bar while politely preventing burn-in.

/* === Code notes ===
   N1: Theme colours can be edited by declaring your
	   own changes in the root block for Vanilla+ theme.
   N2: Theme should always be second since a new var
	   was included to change the favourites bar colour.
