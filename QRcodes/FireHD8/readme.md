# Quick guide for Fire HD 8+ to install Google's Play app market

As the new proud owner of a Fire HD 8 tablet, I was disappointed to see Amazon's marketplace hadn't made available all of the applications I typically have access to using my phone. So this quick guide will get you up-and-running. created after  some trial and error for the normies who want to break free and do all of the other Android things they like to do.

**Remember to check Amazon's app market first for everything you wish to install.** Some select applications exist there which may be better optimized for the Amazon Fire HD series of tablets.

_If you see a QR code, you can scan that with any variety of QR code scanners available from Amazon's app market._

### "Checking info" loop
If you open Google Play and after five minutes had elapsed, the info check loop doesn't break, then go into your device settings and under _Apps & Notifications_ view information for each of the four applications you've installed.  

For each, _Force stop_ if applicable, then view _Storage_; _Clear Cache_ if applicable, then _Clear data_. Afterward, try opening Google Play again. This should resolve the issue of not being able to input your Google account credentials for accessing your Google Play-installed applications.

### Solving Alexa's split personality complex
***Do not install Amazon Alexa from the Google Play store.*** Instead, click on your avatar in Google Play, and select _Manage apps & devices_. Browse the _Manage_ tab, then select Amazon Alexa from this list. Tap the kebab menu (`â‹®`) at the upper right and toggle _Enable auto update_ off. (By default, it will be on.)

If you make the dire mistake of installing Alexa from the Play Store, then remove it through device settings and open the Amazon app store to install Amazon Alexa. After pressing _Get_ to download and install it, the button should change to _Update_ to receive the latest version post-update.

### Using alternative app markets
There are many other alternatives to both Amazon and Google's marketplaces. A popular alternative is [UpToDown](https://uptodown-android.en.uptodown.com/android), which if you do not need _any_ of Google's services, should help in finding everything you need (so long they do not rely on Google Play services). An alternative focusing _only_ on open-source applications is [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org), if you do not want a market catering to the needs of people seeking proprietary, closed-source applications.  

While vendors providing their own storefronts will always have the most current version of their own applications, _these vendors may not have the latest version of hosted applications in their repositories_ so that is worth bearing in mind while browsing other markets, either online or through dedicated applications for browsing their selection.

Where applicable, **disable automatic updates for Amazon Alexa through these other vendors.** Just like Google Play, you may inadvertently install a copy of Alexa from other vendors, which may cause similar issues to  installing the build from Google Play.
