  <h1>Seedminer Boot9Strap CFW the easy way<br><small>A tutorial for people who just want to <i>get it done.</i></small></h1>
  <h2><small>Guide and poor HTML coding by Heebeejeebees.</small></h2>
  <div class="info msg">For help with most Nintendo Homebrew things, there's a Discord guild for that. This guide is not associated with them, but you can join there anyway for general inqueries.</div> <br>
  <div class="info msg">Can you keep a secret? There is another small guild which openly discusses piracy, and in a bid to prevent trouble for either, the two should be considered mutually-exclusive and unaffiliated with one another. If your intention is to use this guide for downloading retail titles freely, you might want to join there instead. </div> <br>

    <div class="head sec">
      <h2>Preface and summary</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="warn msg">This guide is intended for use with 3DS firmware 11.4 - 11.6.0-39. Any future firmware may cause the console to brick and become unusable when applying these instructions to a stock console.</div> <br>
    <div class="info msg">Any reference to 3DS also applies for 2DS, meaning that regardless of model these instructions will apply.</div> <br>
    <div class="good msg">After completing these instructions, it is safe to update Boot9Strap, Luma3DS and the console firmware.</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>The reason this guide exists is because I grew tired of telling people the same turns of phrase which serve to do nothing more than waste time and confuse people who cannot keep up with what I am saying, and for me to link so people can follow along with the same series of instructions which haven't failed any persons I had assisted as of yet. As this is a very straight-forward and to-the-point guide for people who just want to <i>get it done</i>, these instructions are optimized for speed and limited handling of media. </p>
      <h4>After having followed these instructions, you will have the following in your 3DS' SD card:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Boot9Strap</span>, a loader for ARM9 / ARM11</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luma3DS</span>, a custom firmware (hereon: <span style="font-style: italic;">CFW</span>) which depends upon Boot9Strap (hereon: <span style="font-style: italic;">B9S</span>) or ARM9LoaderHax (hereon: <span style="font-style: italic;">A9LH</span>)</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GodMode9</span>, a pre-boot file manager and root-level script executor dependent on Luma3DS' payload execution </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DSP1</span>, a dumping utility to support sound for homebrew applications</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Luma3DS Updater</span>, a utility for updating Luma3DS through the console when new releases are available </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Homebrew Launcher</span>, a utility for launching programs compiled as <span style="font-family: monospace;">.3dsx</span> binaries</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FBI</span>, a utility for using CTR Importable Archive binaries (hereon: <span style="font-style: italic;">CIA</span>) to install games and applications </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anemone Theme Manager</span>, an open-source utility for installing themes and bootsplashes</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Checkpoint</span>, a save manager for 3DS and DSiWare titles</li>
      </ul>
      </h3>
      <h4>The following GodMode9 scripts may also be executed</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">setup_ctrnand_luma3ds</span>, a script which will copy Luma3DS into system memory so the console isn't dependent on the presence of an SD card</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">cleanup_sd_card</span>, a script to delete unnecessary files for operation, including the cias directory which will be included with the archive provided</li>
        <li>The built-in script for backing up the system memory entirely as a file on SD card</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The following additional steps can also be performed after installation of CFW</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Installation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">FTPD</span>, an FTP server for 3DS through FBI's access to TitleDB</li>
        <li>Installation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Freeshop</span>, an open-source clone of Nintendo's eShop with title management</li>
        <li>Installation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">InputRedirectionQt</span> for use of Luma3DS' input redirection, a feature to use controllers attached to a PC</li>
        <li>Installation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Snickerstream</span> for casting video from the console onto PC</li>
