/*//META{"name":"Collapsible UI â€” Miniature voice indicator","description":"Provides miniature voice indicators to see people talking without expanding the sidebar. Use with Collapsible UI. See code for notes and use details.","author":"Hebgbs","version":"1.0"}*//**/

/* === Preface ===
   After having collapsed the sidebar, it had come to my
   attention that sometimes it's hard to see if anyone is
   in a voice chat. WHile an end-user has to expand the
   sidebar to visit one, once inside this code allows for
   the sidebar to remain cioollapsed, yet see indicators
   to see if anyone is in there, and if anyone is speaking.

   === Function summary ===
   A pseudochild is created for the user, taking advantage
   of the provided states for user voice interaction by
   providing a colour-changing indicator. By default it is
   grey, when speaking it becomes green. These indicators
   are hissen when the sidebar is hovered over, as to not
   provide redundant information when expanded.
