  <h2><small>Guide and poor HTML coding by Heebeejeebees / Hebgbs.</small></h2>
  <div class="info msg"><a href="https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp">For help with most Nintendo Homebrew things, there's a Discord guild for that.</a> This guide is not associated with them, but you can join there anyway for general inqueries.</div> <br>
  <div class="info msg">If you are interested in free games and other topics Nintendo Homebrew may outright ban you for, ask whoever gave you this page about another guild more open to that kind of discussion. Otherwise, you'll be finished with this guide at section 5.</div> <br>
  <div class="text">
    <div class="head sec">
      <h2>Preface and summary</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="warn msg">This guide is intended for use with <i>completely stock</i> 3DS consoles using firmware 11.4 - 11.6.0-39. Following these instructions with an Arm9LoaderHax-modifed console or with future firmware installed prior to modification will brick the console. Don't even try.</div> <br>
    <div class="info msg">Any reference to 3DS also applies for 2DS, meaning that regardless of model these instructions will apply.</div> <br>
    <div class="good msg">After completing these instructions, it is safe to update Boot9Strap, Luma3DS and the console firmware.</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>The reason this guide exists is because I grew tired of telling people the same turns of phrase which serve to do nothing more than waste time and confuse people who cannot keep up with what I am saying, and for me to link so people can follow along with the same series of instructions which haven't failed any persons I had assisted as of yet. As this is a very straight-forward and to-the-point guide for people who just want to <i>get it done</i>, these instructions are optimized for speed and limited handling of media.</p>
      <h3>After having followed these instructions, you will have the following in your 3DS' SD card:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Boot9Strap</b>, a loader for ARM9 / ARM11.</li>
        <li><b>Luma3DS</b>, a custom firmware (hereon: <i>CFW</i>) which depends upon Boot9Strap (hereon: <i>B9S</i>) or ARM9LoaderHax (hereon: <i>A9LH</i>).</li>
        <li><b>GodMode9</b>, a file manager and root-level script executor dependent on Luma3DS' payload execution.</li>
        <li><b>DSP1</b>, a dumping utility to support sound for homebrew applications.</li>
        <li><b>Luma3DS Updater</b>, a utility for updating Luma3DS through the console when new releases are available.</li>
        <li><b>Homebrew Launcher</b>, a utility for launching programs compiled as <code>.3dsx</code> binaries.</li>
        <li><b>FBI</b>, a utility for using CTR Importable Archive binaries (hereon: <i>CIA</i>) to install games and applications.</li>
        <li><b>Anemone Theme Manager</b>, an open-source utility for installing themes and bootsplashes.</li>
        <li><b>Checkpoint</b>, a save manager for 3DS and DSiWare titles.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The following websites may be utilized:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://seedhelper.figgyc.uk"><b>Seedhelper</b></a> for remote use of seedminer using volunteer machines.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jenkins.nelthorya.net/job/DSIHaxInjector/"><b>Jenkins (Project DSIHaxInjector)</b></a> for compiling your CFW entrypoint.</li>
        <li><a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/finalizing-setup"><b>3DS Hacks Guide's "Finalizing Setup"</b></a> page for finishing up and use of other software.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The following GodMode9 scripts may also be executed:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>setup_ctrnand_luma3ds</code>, a script which will copy Luma3DS into system memory so the console isn't dependent on the presence of an SD card.</li>
        <li><code>cleanup_sd_card</code>, a script to delete unnecessary files for operation, including the cias directory which will be included with the archive provided.</li>
        <li>The built-in script for backing up the system memory entirely as a file on SD card.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The following additional steps can also be performed after installation of CFW:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Installation of <b>FTPD</b>, an FTP server for 3DS through FBI's access to TitleDB.</li>
        <li>Installation of <b>Freeshop</b>, an open-source clone of Nintendo's eShop with title management.</li>
        <li>Installation of <b>InputRedirectionQt</b> for use of Luma3DS' input redirection, a feature to use controllers attached to a PC.</li>
        <li>Installation of <b>Snickerstream</b> for casting video from the console onto PC.</li>

<h2>Section 1 — Preparation</h2>
</button>
    <div class="hidden body text">
      <p>Before even beginning upon this saga that is the ritual of single-console CFW via this method, you need to make sure you have brought everything you can ever possibly need. Without any of this, you may find it impossible, or at least difficult to install custom firmware into your 3DS.</p>
      <h3>You will need the following</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>USD3 in your Nintendo eShop account.</li>
        <li>A stock 3DS, old or new.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Optionally, this may help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer with a good GPU.</li>
        <li>Python 3.6 (preferably) or 2.7.</li>
        <li>Another person to assist with their modified console.
          <ul>
            <li>Ask someone who already had their console modified.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>An Amazon gift card worth USD5 if lacking funds.</li>
        <li>An SD card larger than 4GB.
          <ul>
            <li>Only if it's full of save data already: A system memory backup requires <b>1.2GB</b>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div> <br>
  <div><button class="sec headc">
<h2>Section 2 — Initial steps</h2>
</button>
    <div class="hidden text">
      <div class="info msg"> If you have to, go into Windows Explorer's options and disable hiding of known file extensions. As it is beyond the scope of this guide, search for this information yourself.</div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>After having fulfilled everything in the above section, only <i>then</i> are you ready to begin without encountering any future difficulties. Unlike other guides online, this one provides a single archive providing a <i>universal</i> set of files <b>up to 11.6.0-39</b>.</p>
        <h3>On the console</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the Nintendo eShop.</li>
          <li><a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(dsiware-game-injection-list)">
Purchase an injectable game from this list.</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Keep that page open;</b> Information from it may help you later.</li>
            <li>If you aren't sure, purchase SUDOKU. The file generated with the process below will be <code>4B344445.bin</code> (USA) or <code>4B344456.bin</code> (EUR). There is no SUDOKU equivalent for JPN but any of the listed games for that region will work.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Exit the eShop and open System Settings; Go to Data Management, DSiWare.</li>
          <li>Find SUDOKU and copy it onto the SD card. <i>Permit this operation in the following prompt.</i></li>
          <li>Power off the Nintendo 3DS and remove the SD card.</li>
          <li>If you own a console with the "new" wordmark, you can do one better: Go into microSD Management and connect with your PC instead.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3> On the computer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://hebgbs.github.io/seedkit.zip">Download this archived suite of files.</a>
            <ul>
              <li>All files in this archive were obtained from 3ds.hacks.guide and have already been assembled in the correct fashion for execution on the 3DS.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Extract the contents of the archive onto the root of the SD card.
              <ul>
                <li>This means all directories and files should be <i>alongside</i> Nintendo 3DS, not <i>inside</i> of it, and especially <i>not</i> in its own directory.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Navigate to <code>Nintendo 3DS</code>; you should see two directories.
              <ul>
                <li>If you see more than two, search for the filename of the game you had copied, per the list you may had previously obtained it from. Results should show one entry in <code>Nintendo 3DS/[id0]/[id1]/Nintendo DSiWare</code>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Copy your id0.
              <ul>
                <li>It is <i>the name of</i> the 32-character directory alongside <code>Private</code>.</li>
                <li>You can use your file manager's rename function to copy it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

<h2>Section 3 — Seedminer</h2>

    <div class="hidden text">
      <div class="warn msg"> If you do not have a good GPU (anything around 2008) inside your machine by nVidia, AMD or an AIB using either company's hardware, you may not be able to mine your seed quickly.</div> <br>
      <div class="good msg"> <a href="https://seedhelper.figgyc.uk">Fortunately, there is an
alternative to doing it yourself via Seedhelper.</a> Your <code>movable_part1.sed</code> can still be obtained from another person if you are wary about feeding your friend code into something you have less control of.</div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>This process is necessary for decrypting a special file on the 3DS later used with a service for compiling your CFW entrypoint. Without it, you may not be able to install CFW into the 3DS without using a different method.</p>
        <h3> Requirements for installing and using seedminer.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Python 3.6 (preferred) or 2.7, from <a href="https://python.org">Python Software Foundation's landing page.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/zoogie/seedminer/releases">Seedminer itself.</a></li>
          <li>Your console's <code>movable_part1.sed</code> (hereon: <i>part1</i>), detailed below.</li>
          <li>The console's first 32 characters of its SHA-256 hash (hereon: <i>id0</i>), detailed below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Obtaining your part1</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="good msg"> Seedhelper can aid with this, the provided instructions below are for when the service is down. Instead of these instructions, you can use it to obtain your <code>movable_part1.sed</code></div>
      <div class="body">
        <ol>
          <li>Befriend someone with a modified console.
            <ul>
              <li>Seedstarter <i>does not work</i> with provisionally added friends: Both sides must friend one another.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Whoever is assisting you also needs to have <code>seedstarter.3dsx</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/zoogie/seedminer/releases">seedminer Github repository.</a></li>
          <li>Your assistant then needs to open seedstarter on their console.</li>
          <li>Assistant then follows the prompts, pressing <code>B</code>, <code>A</code>, then <code>Start</code> in seedstarter.</li>
          <li>After obtaining all friend's seeds, assistant then needs to access the <code>seedstarter</code> directory on their console's SD card.</li>
          <li>Assistant must find the <code>.sed</code> file with the friend code of the user they are assisting and rename it to <code>movable_part1.sed</code>.
            <ul>
              <li><i>Example</i>: <code>0_<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255);">1234_4567_7890</span>.sed</code> becomes <code>movable_part1.sed</code> for use with whoever has friend code <span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255);">1234-4567-7890</span>. </li>
            </ul>

<h2>Section 6 — Other 3DS software</h2>
</button>
    <div class="hidden body text">
      <p>There is some other cool software you can install via FBI's TitleDB menu. As there is no additional preparation necessary, This section should be fairly straight-forward, especially compared with the long-winded process which permits the installation of such software. When finished, you will have<b>FTPD</b> and<b>Freeshop</b> made available to you. There is a <b>lot</b> of other software via TitleDB but the two mentioned are what may be considered most useful for games, patches and remote interaction with the SD card.</p>
      <h2>Software installation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open FBI, and navigate to <code>TitleDB</code>.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the F's to select and download <code>Freeshop</code>.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the S's to select and download <code>Super ftpd ii turbo</code>.
          <ul>
            <li>To navigate through the list faster, left and right act as page up and page down respectively.</li>
            <li>For multiple entries in TitleDB, the bottom-most one is usually the latest.</li>
            <li>When prompted, FBI will provide two options for installation. As follows;
              <ul>
                <li class="txtli"><code>CIA</code>: Installs to system memory and creates a shortcut in Home Menu.</li>
                <li class="txtli"><code>3DSX</code>: installs to <code>3ds</code> on SD card, only accessible through the Homebrew Launcher.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Exit FBI and unwrap your gifts.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Freeshop configuration</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open Freeshop.
          <ul>
            <li>As TitleDB installs 4.1.0 which was released around Halloween, Bernard Herrmann's <i>The Murder</i> score from Psycho plays instead of Freeshop's default splash music.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After the change log, tap on the gear (⚙️) to access settings.</li>
        <li>Select the <code>Update</code> tab and perform the following:
          <ol>
            <li>Enable <code>Auto-update title keys from URL</code>.</li>
            <li>Tap on the keyboard (⌨️) which becomes available.</li>
            <li>Give the input box this address: <code style="color: lime;">http://3ds.titlekeys.gq/downloadenc</code>.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Once finished, select <code>Refresh Cache</code> and enjoy unfettered access to over 4000 games.</li>
      </ol> Or, you can continue to look in settings at the following tabs:
      <ul>
        <li class="txtli"><code>Filter</code>: Adjust what titles are displayed based on region, genre, language, origin platform and publisher.
          <ul>
            <li>The <code>Feature</code> tab has nothing, and crashes the console. Don't bother.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="txtli"><code>Sort</code>: Adjust how games are sorted by release date, name, size, rating or vote tally.</li>
        <li class="txtli"><code>Inactivity</code>: Adjust which screens and features are disabled after a specified timeout.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Wireless transfer via FTP</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your computer's FTP client.
          <ul>
            <li>Don't have one? <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">Filezilla client</a> is a solid multi-platform choice.</li>
            <li>If you are forced to use a less capable device such as a Smartphone, the Android platform has various FTP utilities as well. One I recommend is ES File Explorer, which makes FTP navigation a cakewalk on mobile.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Open FTPD on the 3DS.</li>
        <li>At the top of the screen, IP and port are shown. As follows, this information is used in the two fields on Filezilla:
          <ul>
            <li>IP address goes into the<b>Host</b> field.</li>
            <li>Port goes into the<b>Port</b> field (with FTPD's default being <code>5000</code>).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To exit after file transfers had completed, press <code>B</code> twice.</li>
      </ol>

<h2>Section 7 — 3DS operation from PC</h2>
</button>
    <div class="hidden text">
      <div class="warn msg">Input redirection features, until otherwise rectified is for WIndows machines only.</div> <br>
      <div class="warn msg">As video casting is processor-intensive, BootNTR for this purpose is only suitable for "new" consoles.</div> <br>
      <div class="info msg">While Snickerstream is only compiled for Windows, it should run well in Wine.</div> <br>
      <div class="body">
        <p>If you ever imagined about using your 3DS on your PC, well... <b>you can.</b> The overgrown asterisk in the room is the difference in processing power between consoles. If you are in possession of Nintendo's later "new" consoles you can do everything shown here. Else all you can do is use another controller attached to your PC, which may be beneficial for persons who dislike the 3DS' (lack of) ergonomics but still want to enjoy their titles.</p>
        <h2>Knowing the console's IP</h2>
        <p>As follows, perform these steps to enable reception of remote inputs and reveal the console's IP address:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hold <code>L</code> and <code>Down</code> while pressing <code>Select</code> to cue Luma3DS' Rosalina menu.
            <ul>
              <li>If you had changed this key combination since, use whatever it was you assigned it to.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Select <code>Miscellaneous options</code>.</li>
          <li>Se;ect <code>Start InputRedirection</code>.</li>
          <li>Press <code>B</code> to back out until you see the console's IP address.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With the IP address noted, you can begin installing utilities on the PC which can utilize this information to connect with the console.</p>
        <h2>Acquiring software for remote operation</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="info msg">Both devices needs to be on the same network for any network-based utilities to function.</div>
      <div class="body">

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Installing acquired software</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Extract archives for Input Redirection Client and Snickerstream to somewhere memorable.
            <ul>
              <li>For tidiness, the suite of files from this archive should be in their own directory.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Transfer the <code>.cia</code> file into the 3DS' SD card.
            <ul>
              <li>Had you set this up earlier, you can use FTP should SMB via the native microSD Management feature be of no use.</li>
              <li>The cleanup script ran during installation of CFW will had deleted the <code>cias</code> directory; FBI can install from anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Open FBI.
            <li>Select <code>SD</code>, then find the CIA file there.</li>
            <li>After installing it, exit FBI and unwrap your gift.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Configuring and use of installed software</h2>
        <h3>Input Redirection</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Input Redirection Client.</li>
          <li>Enable Input Redirection on the 3DS.</li>
          <li>Give it your console's IP address.
            <ul>
              <li>If you prefer button placement to match the console, enable the boxes for inverting the face buttons.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Video casting</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="warn msg">Some items may simply not work, and launching certain titles while casting may crash the console.</div> <br>
      <div class="info msg">Crashes will not permanently disable the console; simply hold down the power button until the lights go out and power it back on.</div>
      <div class="body">
        <ol>
          <li>On the 3DS, open BootNTR selector.</li>
          <li>Go along with default everything, and select version 3.6.</li>
          <li>Return to home menu.</li>
          <li>Launch Snickerstream.
            <ul>
              <li>In doing this, a new <code>settings.ini</code> file is made where the executable exists. These settings may be of interest:
                <ul>
                  <li class="txtli"><code>IpAddr</code>: The default console IP address Snickerstream will look for.</li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Give Snickerstream the console's IP address. (It's the same one you give to Input Redirection Client.)
            <li>In the Preset section, specify _Best framerate_ to test, initially.</li>
            <li>Choose to connect; If it worked, scale video with <code>[Up]</code> and <code>[Down]</code> on the keyboard.</li>
            <li>When finished streaming, press <code>[Esc]</code> to exit.</li>
        </ol>
