/*//META{"name":"Collapsible UI w/ Gibbu's Horizontal Serverlist","description":"Provides automatically hiding sidebar and guildbar to provision more space for chat messages. Integrates GIbbu's Horizontal Serverlist; Use this by itself.","author":"Hebgbs","version":"1.5"}*//**/

/* === Preface ===
   The intent of this code is to make interface elements
   normally persistent but less used automatically move
   away from the main viewport, as to be out of the way.
   
   === Function summary ===
   The tricks used to make this possible is by use of
   transform on the scrolling elements of the sidebar
   as well flipping and repositioning whatever elements
   affected by this change as necessary. Hovering over
   the containers for each will reveal them in full
   which would permit interaction of the sidebar and
   guild bar. The inclusion of Gibbu's Horizontal
   Serverlist mod better realizes this code's intent. */

   === Variable notes ===
N1: Absolute definition; What you set is what you get.

N2: If use causes disorientation, define this. Once
    cursor is away, element is temporarily visible.
    
N3: Relative definition for sum of [x] + default;
    Define [x] to set total rather than absolute.
    
N4: Change if theme makes unread pill hard to see.

N5: Change if voiceuser or "+" symbol is not where it
    should be compared to defintion in theme.

   === Code notes ===
N6: Beta effects are held in another sheet. In case
    you don't want them, remove the PTB-CUI import.
    On the other hand, if you want to modify it then
    add CUI-diffuse, CUI-invert and CUI-bright into
    your custom CSS's :root block.
N7: It's kind of hacky. Then again, what isn't with
    BetterDiscord? Optimal settings with this code:
    -o Close other Folders when selecting a Folder
    o- Close the Folder when selecting a Server
    -o Close All Folders when selecting a Server
    o- Force a Folder to open when switching to...
    o- Display Badge for Amount of Servers in a Folder
    o- Adds separators between Servers of different...
