# Greetings, friend.

Welcome to **Linux Enthusiast Group**. We are glad you have arrived — we hope your stay here is pleasant as you begin to let us know you, and request assistance for any issues with your Linux distribution you are unable to resolve on your own.


Our primary ambition for this guild is to provide a safe space for ratoinal people who wish for nothing more but to engage in good, _clean_ discussion about all things open source, preferably without any  major ideological biases and _civil_ discourse about all things controversial when applicable.

# Basic rules
With that said, here are our major rules we will cite when any of them are breached:
1. Be excellent to each other.
2. Do not impersonate community staff.
3. Do not post not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content.
4. No illegal services or service scams.
5. Attempt to use channels as they are intended.
6. Use English for communication.

You can refer to this list _any time_ by going to [#rules](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225689437944676352).

We understand there is a lot of interpetation with these rules, and that is intended — not any one human being can, nor should be expected to conform with any one given state of cognition 100%, as all beings are individual and dunique in their own various ways. However, we _do_ have limits of tolerance, and will exercise force in varying degrees to ensure the health of our guild and the members therein.

# Rule explanations
below are expansions of rules based on the above:

### _Be excellent to each other_
1. Do not treat with any degree of disrespect or act in authority against a person's lifestyle choices and preferences. If any of such are of concern and you believe it to be detrimental of the guild as a whole, let it be known to members of staff in private — we are always open to receiving such concerns and will exercise action against anything we do not deem acceptable.
2. Do not use Discord features to exercise controversy. This includes nicknames, banners, avatars and other personalization features.
3. Do not publish content that is insensitive to persons who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. If you are uncertain, we will ket you know if anything may fit this criteria.
4. _Specific to memes_, do not weaponize them. Any use of #memes to cause harm against other users or person-groups will **not** be tolerated.

### _Do not impersonate community staff_
Not just in our community, but also in _any other community outside of here._ We will automatically jail and interrogate about the rationale for this, and not relent until you comply with this rule, or ban as a final judgment in response to continued non-compliance.

### _Do not post not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content_
1. We are not a porn service, or affiliated with an adult entertainment platform.
2. We are not a pro-suicide group.
3. We are not a pro-pedophila group.
4. We are not 4chan.
5. No, we do not find NSFW in #memes funny.

We will try to act within compliance of Discord's [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) whenever possible. For your sake, don't try to press your luck with exceedingly suggestive material.

### _No illegal services or service scams_
**Instant ban upon first response breaching this.** Moderator scrutiny against you will also be enhanced when engageing in discussin regarding such. Do not engage in such conduct, or discuss it. You are allowed to DM staff regarding this.

### _Attempt to use channels as they are intended._
Leniency for this rule is exercised as sometimes, people just _don't know_ and if a conversatin stated i one channel, so long the channel isn't attempting to be used by others for its intended purpose discussion _may_ continue.

1. In [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) please try to limit idle discussion — focus on problems.
> We like threads! Try to use them!

2. If providing support, try to use [#tty](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/909461864763752449) for terminal / TTY input / output.
> Try saying _Look in #tty_ or enable dev mode to copy message URIs in Discord.

3. In [#memes](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/900841345315377182) please _try_ to be funny without being exceedingly cringe.
4. Do not treat anywhere else in the guild as #memes.

### _Use English for communication_
We are aware of how disabling it is for people to be forced in using English for communication, but it is the dominant language of the world and the majority of users in Linux Enthusiast Group are capable of communicating in that language.

If you consider this a problem, worry not — your messages will be translated as-needed. _But_ as a best practice try to stick with English if you can.
