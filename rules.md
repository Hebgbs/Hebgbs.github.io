# Greetings, friend.

Welcome to **Linux Enthusiast Group**. We are glad you have arrived — we hope your stay here is pleasant as you begin to let us know you, and request assistance for any issues with your Linux distribution you are unable to resolve on your own.

Our primary ambition for this guild is to provide a safe space for rational people to engage in good, _clean_ discussion about all things open source.  

With that said, here are our major rules:

# Basic rules
1. Be excellent to each other.
2. Do not impersonate community staff.
3. Do not post not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content.
4. No illegal services or service scams.
5. Attempt to use channels as they are intended.
6. Use English for communication.
7. Keep discussion clean and civil.

You can refer to this list _any time_ by going to [#rules](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225689437944676352).

We are imperfect as individuals, regardless of the role we provide. We wish nothing but tolerance and respect for all who willfully conform with these rules stated above to ensure the health and safety of our membership.

# Rule explanations
below are expansions of rules based on the above:

### _Be excellent to each other_
1. Do not treat with any degree of disrespect or act in authority against a person's lifestyle choices and preferences. If any of such are of concern and you believe it to be detrimental of the guild as a whole, let it be known to members of staff privately.
2. Do not use Discord and its account personalization features to act in breach of [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and our [rules](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225689437944676352).
3. Do not publish content that is insensitive to persons who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. We will let you know if anything may fit this criteria if you are not sure.
4. _Of memes specifically_, do not weaponize them. Any use of #memes to cause harm against other users or person-groups will **not** be tolerated.

### _Do not impersonate community staff_
As in, persons wh hoold any position of power, in any community whatsoever. A ban will be administered as an initial response.

### _Do not post not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content_
1. We are not a porn service, or affiliated with an adult entertainment platform.
2. We are not a pro-suicide group.
3. We are not a pro-pedophilia group.
4. We are not 4chan or any of its derivatives.
5. No, we do not find NSFW in #memes funny.

We must act within compliance of Discord's [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) whenever possible. Per Discord's policies, we must act in response to any breach of these guidelines so we remain within compliance and ensure the continued presence of this guild on their platform.

### _No illegal services or service scams_
Do not engage in such conduct, or discuss it with ay degree of depth. **Instant ban upon first response breaching this.** Moderator scrutiny against you will also be enhanced when engageing in discussin regarding such. You are allowed to DM staff regarding this.

### _Attempt to use channels as they are intended._
Leniency for this rule is exercised as sometimes, people just _don't know_ and if a conversatin stated i one channel, so long the channel isn't attempting to be used by others for its intended purpose discussion _may_ continue.

1. In [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) please try to limit idle discussion — focus on problems.
> We like threads! Try to use them!

2. If providing support, try to use [#tty](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/909461864763752449) for terminal / TTY input / output.
> Try saying _Look in #tty_ or enable dev mode to copy message URIs in Discord.

3. Do not treat anywhere else in the guild as #memes.

### _Use English for communication_
We are aware of how disabling it may be for persons who had not learned English as a primary or secondary language to enforce this, but it is the dominant language of the world and the majority of users in Linux Enthusiast Group are capable of communicating in that language. 

You are free to write in your native language if you are unable to present any issues with your distribution in use or with our membership in English, but we would prefer — if you can — to communicate in English.

We will not tolerate mockery of individual persons who are unable to communicate effectively in English. They're trying their best, please be encouraging and inclusive.

### _Keep discussion clean and civil._
There are three things in life that are certain; death, taxes and controversy. If when we encounter any discussion that may be controversial in all immediately-available channels, is it **mandatory** we do not act with lax civility with our fellow man.

If you must act less-than-civil or are uncertain of the civility of response elsewhere, reserve such outbursts in [#rants-and-raves](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225688133101027328). Due to how variable civility may be in that channel, access is gated by means of reaction role. Provide yourself the role to view that channel by reacting with ‼️ in [this post at #assign-role](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/889757833145499648/927838790884675615).
