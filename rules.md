# Greetings, friend.

Welcome to **Linux Enthusiast Group**. We are glad you have arrived ‚Äî we hope your stay here is pleasant as you begin to let us know you, and request assistance for any issues with your Linux distribution you are unable to resolve on your own.

Our primary ambition for this guild is to provide a safe space for rational people to engage in good, _clean_ discussion about all things open source. Support is secondary, as an inevitible consequence of building an open source community and as such, you may with to consult elsewhere for any queries we may be unable to answer effectively.

With that said, here are our major rules:

# Basic rules
1. Be excellent to each other.
2. Do not impersonate community staff.
3. Do not post not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content.
4. No illegal services or service scams.
5. Attempt to use channels as they are intended.
6. Use English for communication.
7. Keep discussion clean and civil.

You can refer to this list _any time_ by going to [#rules](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225689437944676352).

We are imperfect as individuals, regardless of the role we provide. We wish nothing but tolerance and respect for all who willfully conform with these rules stated above to ensure the health and safety of our guild and its membership.

# Rule explanations
below are expansions of the rules stated above. Much of this is to satisfy edge / corner cases, and will be iterated upon as necessary. You will be made aware of these changes as they develop.

### _Be excellent to each other_
1. Do not treat with any degree of disrespect or act in authority against a person's lifestyle choices and preferences. If any of such are of concern and you believe it to be detrimental of the guild as a whole, let it be known to members of staff privately.
2. Do not use Discord and its account personalization features to act in breach of [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and our [rules](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225689437944676352).
3. Do not publish content that is insensitive to persons who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. We will let you know if anything may fit this criteria if you are not sure.
4. **Excellence extends outside of this guild.** Please do not troll other communities, no matter how much they may "Deserve" it.
5. _Of [#memes](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/900841345315377182) specifically_:
   * Do not weaponize them. Any use of #memes to cause harm against other users or person-groups will **not** be tolerated.
   * Do not be perverse. Memes are beholden to the same rules as content in other channels.
   * The memes channel is not your toilet, please do not üí©post solely to generate controversy.
   * Make a best effort to limit posts outside of this channel to relevant topics, as contextual levity is often welcome.

### _Do not impersonate community staff_
As in, persons wh hold any position of power, in any community whatsoever. A ban will be administered as an initial response.

### _Do not post not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content_
1. We say no to:
   * Direct reference of genetailia.
   * Sexual advances toward other members.
   * Exploitation of any member's orientation.
   * Excessive and / or erotic gore.
   * Abuse of people and animals.
   * Intercourse regardless of taxonomy.
 
2. We are not:
   * A porn service.
   * Affiliated with an adult entertainment platform.
   * A pro-suicide group.
   * A pro-pedophilia group.
   * 4chan or any of its derivatives.
   * Fond of NSFW in #memes.

We must act within compliance of Discord's [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) whenever possible. Per Discord's policies, we must act in response to any breach of these guidelines so we remain within compliance and ensure the continued presence of this guild on their platform.

### _No illegal services or service scams_
Do not engage in such conduct, or discuss it with any degree of depth. **Instant ban upon first response breaching this.** Moderator scrutiny against you will also be enhanced when engageing in discussin regarding such. You are allowed to DM staff regarding this.

### _Attempt to use channels as they are intended._
Leniency for this rule is exercised as sometimes, people just _don't know_ and if a conversatin stated i one channel, so long the channel isn't attempting to be used by others for its intended purpose discussion _may_ continue.

1. In [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) please try to limit idle discussion ‚Äî focus on problems.
   * We like threads! Try to use them!
2. If providing support, try to use [#tty](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/909461864763752449) for terminal / TTY input / output.
   * Try saying _Look in #tty_ or enable dev mode to copy message URIs in Discord.
3. Try not to treat anywhere else in the guild as #memes.

### _Use English for communication_
We are aware of how disabling it may be for persons who had not learned English as a primary or secondary language to enforce this, but it is the dominant language of the world and the majority of users in Linux Enthusiast Group are capable of communicating in that language. 

You are free to write in your native language if you are unable to present any issues with your distribution in use or with our membership in English, but we would prefer ‚Äî if you can ‚Äî to communicate in English.

We will not tolerate mockery of individual persons who are unable to communicate effectively in English. They're trying their best, please be encouraging and inclusive.

### _Keep discussion clean and civil._
There are three things in life that are certain; death, taxes and controversy. If when we encounter any discussion that may be controversial in all immediately-available channels, is it **mandatory** we act with the utmost of civility toward our fellow man.

If you must act less-than-civil or are uncertain of the civility of response elsewhere, reserve such outbursts in [#rants-and-raves](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/225688133101027328). Due to how variable civility may be in that channel, access is gated by means of reaction role. Provide yourself the role to view that channel by reacting with ‚ÄºÔ∏è in [this post at #assign-role](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/889757833145499648/927838790884675615).

# [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) guidelines
1. **If you do not know, you do not know.** While shooting advice from the hip and flying blind with nothing but one's own intuition can _occasionally_ help as hints and clues toward the solution for a given problem, limiting speculation is _key_ to successfully resolving any given problem.
2. Presenting the issue first-and-foremost is of utmost importance to begin evaluation of a solution for a given problem. _Never start with "Hello"._ ‚Äî we can't help with just a greeting!
3. Provide all informatin you have for a given problem. If you aren't sure what the answer to your ongoing issue(s) may be based on that, somebody else might!
4. Toxicity helps nobody, so do not become toxic toward persons who are not able to effectively communicate their problem. _Give people time_ and provide improvements to any explanations provided if possible so if you cannot help, persons who could help elsewhere can receive an issue with greater clarity.
5. Do not write in multiple lines what can be explained in a single post. On discretion of staff at time of receiving, it may be considered spam and removed.
6. **Use threads!** You have permission to create threads in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/675194889146859568) so you have no excuse as to why you can't. They help with indexing problems and isolating conversation so your issues are less likely to get lost in the channel!

# [#botcmds](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/673343034284310574) stuff
### Bumping
We have two bots that can be used for this and they _both_ use command `/bump`. You can bump on Disboard every three hours, while you can only bump once every 24 hours on discordservers.com.

### Music
You are free to play music and video content, but please do not be offensive about it. If your content includes excessive profane lyrics, or is intentionally meant to offend as many persons as possible it _might_ not be nest to play it in our guild.

Core exceptions to this are instrumentals (without offensive samples) and songs with offensive titles, but without lyrics and devoid of gross depictions.

### Image bombing
Abuse of carl's image-bombing features such as `catbomb`, `dogbomb` and `awwbomb` will be considered spam and you will be timed out for such behaviour. Image-bombing is **strictly** limited to [#botcmds](https://discord.com/channels/225678837051031552/673343034284310574).
